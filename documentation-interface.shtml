They are coded to implement a single trading strategy. They consume data from sensors and indicators and use their built-in logic to make trading decisions such as opening, moving or closing positions.</br><a href="documentation-algobots.shtml" target="_blank"><em>More about Algobots</em></a></span></span>
                            and have set it to perform some backtesting, you can use the platform charts to visualize its actions and debug the strategy. Being able to visually review your algobot's trades is an essential part of the optimization process as it may help you fine-tune your its decision-making.

                        <p>The charts interface is an HTML canvas featuring three overlaid <em>visual spaces</em> working simultaneously:</p>

                        <ul>

                        <ol>

                            <li><p>This is the <em>products panel</em> featuring products of bots registered on the platform.</p></li>

                            <li><p>This is the <em>time information panel</em>, featuring information regarding the date and time of the current candle, and time period or scale currently ploted in the timeline.</p></li>

                            <li><p>This is the <em>current candle panel</em> providing additional information about the candle filled in yellow in the candlestick chart. This panel is too generated by the Plotters-Candles-Volumes used by Olivia to help visualize her products.</p></li>

                            <li><p>This is the <em>current volume panel</em>, which works pretty much like the current candle panel.</p></li>

                            <li>

                                <p>This horizontal space between the charts and the bottom bar is used to control <em>chart breakpoints</em> when running on backtest mode. Click on the space to place a breakpoint and click on a breakpoint to remove it. Chart breakpoints are used to visually debug the trading strategy, pausing execution when the corresponding candle becomes active.</p>

                                <p>In order for chart breakpoints to actually pause execution at the specific point in time in which it was placed, you first need to place a breakpoint in the following line of the <em>User.Bot.js</em> code:</p>

<pre><code class="JavaScript language-JavaScript">
if (global.AT_BREAKPOINT === true) {
      if (FULL_LOG === true) { logger.write(MODULE_NAME, "[INFO] run -> loop -> Plot Breakpoint Hit."); } // Place breakpoint in this line
}
</code></pre>

                                <p>Upon execution, a chart breakpoint pauses execution and takes the user to that specific line of code, provided that a breakpoint was placed at that line in the first place.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><p>This is the <em>running mode</em> control. Click it and you will cycle through the three available running options: backtest, live and competition. Select which mode you wish to run your algobot in and click play.</p></li>

                            <li><p>These are the <em>scale button</em> and the <em>delete button</em>:</p></li>

                                <li><p>Place the pointer on top of the <em>scale button</em> and turn the mouse wheel to adjust the price scale. This button is only available when the zoom is at it's maximum level.</p></li>

                                <li><p>Click the <em>delete button</em> to delete backtest, live or competition history data (depending on what mode you are running). You will start over with fresh data. </p></li>
