                        <p>We aim to create a superior trading intelligence capable of outperforming every other participant in the markets. Such intelligence will certainly enable a number of businesses, which will depend on the project's systems to run successfully.</p>

                        <p>In order to achieve maximum resilience, Dev Teams develop one or two components each only, with the exception of a few pioneer teams who may have developed more than one in early stages.

                        <p>The project allocates 15% of the total supply of ALGO tokens to the System Development Pool.</p>
                        <p>The incentive scheme is based on Dev Teams undertaking responsibility over specific <i>concepts</i>, which usually map to one or more system components. For instance, the concept of <i>users</i> is handled by the <i>Users Backend Module</i> and the <i>Users Frontend Module</i>.</p>
                        <p>Each concept is allocated a fraction of the System Development Pool. The precise allocation depends on the concept's <i>category</i>, which is a function of the level of criticality, urgency and difficulty. </p>
                        <p>There are five categories, from 1 to 5.</p>

                        <p>The category number indicates the amount of ALGO tokens to be allocated to Dev Teams undertaking responsibility on a specific concept, expressed in millions (<i>i.e.</i>: a category 5 concept allocates 5 million tokens), as shown below. Bear in mind that 5 million ALGO represent 0.5% of the total supply.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned earlier, in order for incentives to be sustainable in the long term, the project will also implement a maintenance fee payable by all financial beings running on the platform. </p>
                        <p>More details on maintenance fees will be available in the future. Suffice to say, the project fully understands the critical nature of the maintenance of a system that will play an important role in the global trading landscape. Such incentive is going to be implemented in a way that guarantees the service level that businesses running on the software require.</p>

                        <p>Dev Teams are expected to assume <i>full responsibility</i> over a specific <i>concept</i>, for instance, users, teams or events. Many times, a concept maps directly to one or more specific components, but is not necessarily limited to that.</p>
                        <p>This distinction is instrumental to understanding the scope of the responsibility of Dev Teams, in particular because the Superalgos system is meant to evolve over time. Evolution of the system may entail the need to integrate new components or even new requirements that may emerge resulting from the expansion of business needs.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-6">
                        <p>Assuming full responsibility implies that Dev Teams are in charge of producing their own requirements, developing the components and maintaining them in the long term. As such, teams are expected to get truly close to the project, becoming a fundamental piece of the machinery.</p>
                        <p>While we foresee components stabilizing after a period of time, as explained earlier, the project is in constant evolution. Any new piece of functionality or requirement falling within the scope of a certain concept, requires the prompt attention of the Dev Team responsible for that concept.</p>

                        <p>As general requirements, Dev Teams are expected to maintain a clear README.md file and a thorough change log. We also encourage proper use of git comments and maintaining a clean git workflow.</p>
                        <p>Depending on the component, the first working version is estimated to require roughly 1 to 2 months of development effort for a senior developer working full time or a similar time for a team of two developers working part time. Should your team count with more resources, it shouldn't be a problem to deliver the component much faster.</p>
                        <p>The development workflow exhibits two distinct phases: <i>open requirements</i> and <i>free development</i>.</p>
                        <p>The first task Dev Teams face after getting acquainted with the system and the functionality falling within the concept on which they are assuming responsibility is to draft their own requirements sheet, kick starting the open requirements phase.</p>

                        <p>Requirements are then discussed with the Core Team and the rest of the teams, in particular those responsible for adjacent or intersecting functionality, and are eventually approved, after any number of iterations.</p>
                        <p>Teams are autonomous and may freely decide how to organize their work internally. However, we do require teams to work under an <span class="tooltip-custom">agile development<span class="tooltiptext-custom" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Agile software development</strong> is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.</br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Wikipedia: Agile Software Development</em></a></span></span> approach, attending one technical meeting per week and pushing batches of functionality to the <i>develop branch</i> at least once per month.</p>
                        <p>Once requirements have been completed, tested and pushed to the production environment, the free development phase starts. The components pushed to production are considered alpha stage, so teams iterate on the first version, making improvements and correcting bugs until the code is stable.</p>
                        <p>Dev Teams are expected to stay close to the project for the long run, as even after the code has been stabilized, new requirements may arise.</p>

                        <p>The number of tokens reserved for each pool is related to the concept's category. There are five categories, from one to five. The category number indicates the amount of ALGO tokens in the pool expressed in millions (<i>i.e.</i> a category 1 pool has 1 million tokens).</p>
                        <p>The category number is a reflection of the perceived level of criticality, urgency and difficulty entailed in the particular concept. The higher the number, the more critical, urgent and / or difficult the area of responsibility is recognized to be.</p>
                        <p>All category 5 concepts have been assigned already, thus, concepts available now span from category 1 to category 4.</p>

The miner may be paused in cases when a team becomes unresponsive or does not satisfy the service level agreements established for maintenance. Should a Dev Team become a liability for the project for whatever reason, the Core Team may decide to stop the miner and find a replacement for the team at fault.</p>

                        <p>Let's use an example to bring down to earth everything said so far.</p>
                        <p>A team of three developers wishes to contribute to the development of the Superalgos System. They get in touch with the project, meet the technical core team maintaining the <a href="https://github.com/Superalgos" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Superalgos organization in Github</a>, discuss priorities and apply to work on a specific concept.</p>
                        <p>The selected concept becomes their area of responsibility. </p>
                        <p>Every piece of functionality identified (or to be identified) that logically falls within the scope of that particular concept becomes the team's responsibility. Their mission is to develop the corresponding components, refine them and maintain them.</p>
                        <p>The team starts out by joining regular developer meetings, at least once per week; they discuss their concept with other developers, getting acquainted with the system architecture and gathering initial definitions. </p>
                        <p>They present a requirements sheet and agree with the community on the scope of a first usable version of the components, and start programming.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-6">
                        <p>While developing version one of the components, they stay in touch with other developers and the Core Team, consulting on any issues that may arise, while showcasing their progress at developer meetings. </p>
                        <p>Eventually, they start integrating the module into the overall system, polishing the rough edges until the functionality becomes usable.</p>
                        <p>By that time, the rest of developers have become acquainted with the new team, having interacted frequently and followed their work closely. The constant revisions through regular meetings help the new team stay on course, remain focused in priorities and programing following agreed best practices.</p>
                        <p>This initial piece of work is enough to show the rest of developers that the new team is a worthy acquisition. As soon as the software is up and running in the production environment, the team's miner is readily activated and started.</p>
                        <p>The new team is now a key part of the community. It keeps developing their module until the last bit of functionality is integrated. People report bugs until the module stabilizes and requires less and less work. The team stays alert, updating the module every time a new requirement arises.</p>
