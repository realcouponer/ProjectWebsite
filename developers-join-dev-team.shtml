                        <p>Dev Teams are expected to assume <i>full responsibility</i> over a specific <i>concept</i>, for instance, users, teams or events. Many times, a concept maps directly to one or more specific components, but is not necessarily limited to that.</p>
                        <p>This distinction is instrumental to understanding the scope of the responsibility of Dev Teams, in particular because the Superalgos system is meant to evolve over time. Evolution of the system may entail the need to integrate new components or even new requirements that may emerge resulting from the expansion of business needs.</p>

As such, teams are expected to get truly close to the project, becoming a fundamental piece of the machinery.</p>
                        <p>While we foresee components stabilizing after a period of time, as explained earlier, the project is in constant evolution. Any new piece of functionality or requirement falling within the scope of a certain concept, requires the prompt attention of the Dev Team responsible for that concept.</p>

                        <p>Depending on the component, the first working version is estimated to require roughly 1 to 2 months of development effort for a senior developer working full time or a similar time for a team of two developers working part time. Should your team count with more resources, it shouldn't be a problem to deliver the component much faster.</p>
                        <p>The development workflow exhibits two distinct phases: <i>open requirements</i> and <i>free development</i>.</p>
                        <p>The first task Dev Teams face after getting acquainted with the system and the functionality falling within the concept on which they are assuming responsibility is to draft their own requirements sheet, kick starting the open requirements phase.</p>

                        <p>Teams are autonomous and may freely decide how to organize their work internally. However, we do require teams to work under an <!--#include file="tooltips/agile-development.shtml" --> approach, attending one technical meeting per week and pushing batches of functionality to the <i>develop branch</i> at least once per month.</p>
                        <p>Once requirements have been completed, tested and pushed to the production environment, the free development phase starts. The components pushed to production are considered alpha stage, so teams iterate on the first version, making improvements and correcting bugs until the code is stable.</p>
                        <p>Dev Teams are expected to stay close to the project for the long run, as even after the code has been stabilized, new requirements may arise.</p>

                        <p>A team of three developers wishes to contribute to the development of the Superalgos system. They get in touch with the project, meet the technical Core Team maintaining the <a href="https://github.com/Superalgos" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Superalgos organization in Github</a>, discuss priorities and apply to work on a specific concept.</p>
                        <p>The selected concept becomes their <!--#include file="tooltips/area-of-responsibility.shtml" -->. </p>
                        <p>Every piece of functionality identified (or to be identified) that logically falls within the scope of that particular concept becomes the team's responsibility. Their mission is to develop the corresponding components, refine them and maintain them.</p>
                        <p>The team starts out by joining regular developer meetings, at least once per week; they discuss their concept with other developers, getting acquainted with the system architecture and gathering initial definitions. </p>
                        <p>They present a requirements sheet and agree with the community on the scope of a first usable version of the components, and start programming.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-6">
                        <p>While developing version one of the components, they stay in touch with other developers and the Core Team, consulting on any issues that may arise, while showcasing their progress at developer meetings. </p>
                        <p>Eventually, they start integrating the module into the overall system, polishing the rough edges until the functionality becomes usable.</p>
                        <p>By that time, the rest of developers have become acquainted with the new team, having interacted frequently and followed their work closely. The constant revisions through regular meetings help the new team stay on course, remain focused in priorities and programing following agreed best practices.</p>
                        <p>This initial piece of work is enough to show the rest of developers that the new team is a worthy acquisition. As soon as the software is up and running in the production environment, the team's <!--#include file="tooltips/intelli-stream.shtml" --> is readily activated and started.</p>
                        <p>The new team is now a key part of the community. It keeps developing their module until the last bit of functionality is integrated. People report bugs until the module stabilizes and requires less and less work. The team stays alert, updating the module every time a new requirement arises.</p>

                        <p>If at any point in time an individual contributor wishes to step aside, or fails to deliver as per the expectations of the rest of the Dev Teams, the project will help the person make a clean exit by delegating responsibilities into:</p>

                        <p>In the second case, the departing team will keep all the Intelli it may have been allocated up to that point in time.</p>
