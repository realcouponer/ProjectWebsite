                        <p>A superalgo is an artificial intelligence that dynamically combines any number of algorithms within a pool, using a vast bank of trading experiences gathered from hundreds of thousands of live-trading runs and competition matches carefully recorded and catalogued within the supermind's collective memory as the food for its learning processes.</p>
                        <p>The production of algorithms is driven by an open worldwide community of developers, traders and analysts collaborating by engaging in iterative competition cycles. Competitions measure the performance of individual strategies and different forms of algorithms, identifying and selecting promising traits for the community to breed and help evolve.</p>

                        <p>The competition system is designed to explore the widest possible trading universe in order to produce a comprehensive bank of memories covering as many experiences as possible through an array of variables such as markets, market conditions, strategies, or technical implementations.</p>
                        <p>Competition dynamics drive the evolution of three different kinds of algorithms, all of them existing as autonomous agents with a financial life of their own. These financial beings feature varying degrees of intricacy, resulting from the combination of simple algorithms into complex organisms:</p>

                        <h3>Algobots</h3>
                        <p>An algobot is the basic structural and functional unit of trading algorithms running on the platform. They are coded to implement a single trading strategy. </p>
                        <p>They consume data from sensors and indicators and use their built-in logic to make trading decisions such as opening, moving or closing positions.</p>
                        <p>If an Algobot is not successful in its trading job and its performance drops below a pre-defined threshold, it dies.</p>

                        <h3>Algonets</h3>
                        <p>Algonets are organisms which dynamically deploy swarms of algobot clones, assigning each one a unique set of parameters within predefined ranges, allocating a percentage of working capital to each clone. They monitor algobots performance over time and decide which algobots to keep alive and which to let die depending on their performance.</p>
                        <p>Each algonet is made out of algobot clones implementing the same trading strategy. The job of an algonet is to find the best possible structure of algobots to do the trading.</p>

                        <h3>Advanced Algos</h3>
                        <p>Advanced algos function as higher order trading organisms, as their main activity is deploying algonet clones appropriate for the job, taking into account to the strategies each algonet implements.</p>
                        <p>They monitor the performance of algonets and eventually decide which ones to keep and which ones to let die.</p>
                        <p>Thus, advanced algos use multiple strategies in the quest to adapt to changing market conditions and other variables.</p>

                        <p>The nesting of simple trading algos into more complex organisms is &ndash;in essence&mdash;an approach to learning algorithms which use live experiments to explore ranges of possible behaviors and dynamically select the most efficient ones  while discarding the less desirable. These learning mechanisms not only supply a live feedback loop to the organism doing the actual trading, but also stores valuable information to be recalled by the system at any point in time.</p>
                        <p>It is this wealth of memories and real-life trading experiences that superalgos will harness. How exactly they are going to do that will be the outcome of the relentless evolution of the ecosystem and the work of the <a href="about-supermind.shtml#general-specialized-experiences" target="_blank">specialized intelligence segment of the supermind</a>.</p>

                        <p>We also invite experts with a deep understanding of electronic markets, the capital investment space within the financial industry and algorithmic trading in general to join too, so as to help guide the IT efforts from the user and business case perspectives.</p>
