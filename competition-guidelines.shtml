                        <p>In the event of a tie, the prize is divided between the tied players: the prizes for the tied spots are added together, and the total is then awarded to the tied players in equal parts.</p>

                        <p>For example, there is a three-way tie for first place. The 1st place is awarded USD 5,000 (no USD prize is awarded to 2nd and 3rd, so nothing to add here) thus, USD 1,666.66 is awarded to each of the tied participants. In addition, a total of 175,000 ALGO is reserved for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place, thus, each participant tied in the 1st place gets 58,300.33 ALGO.</p>

                        <p>Because Superalgos has an open arms policy encouraging developers to join the project's development team and because the Superalgos Community is open for all people, we deliberately allow and urge everyone &ndash;including core team and project team members&mdash;to participate in all competitions. </p>

                        <p>Bear in mind the platform is in a pre-alpha stage. As developers, you should expect eventual errors that may cause inconveniences. Participating in pre-alpha competitions is a way to support the Superalgos project... we very much appreciate your help!</p>
