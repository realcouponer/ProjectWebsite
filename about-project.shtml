                                        <p>The upgrade included a complete redesign of the charting space enabling the setup of dashboards with mutiple charts, and the ability to combine and syncronize data from different exchanges, markets and time frames within time machines.</p>

The data and services offered among nodes may be black-boxed&mdash;offered on an input/output basis, without revealing how the output is obtained&mdash;and sold for micro fees, payable in Intelli Tokens. The transactions may include indicator data, signals or any form of trading intelligence that lives distributed across the network.</p>
