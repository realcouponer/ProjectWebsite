                    <h1 id="thePlatform">The Platform</h1>

                    <p>The Platform is the system created to support the creation, optimization and competition of algobots.</p>

                    <h2 id="aacloud">AACloud</h2>

                    <p>AACloud is the part of the platform that interacts with algobots and puts them to run in the cloud.</p>

                    <h3 id="runjs">Run.js</h3>

                    <p>This is where everything starts:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Run.js makes a number of global definitions (global variables,  constants and parameters),</p></li>

                        <li><p>loads all relevant configuration files (starting from AACloud's <em>this.config.json</em> where each algobot process to be run is listed),</p></li>

                        <li><p>and eventually calls the <em>Main Loop</em> module corresponding to the type of algobot it is running.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="mainloopmodules">Main Loop Modules</h3>

                    <p>The platform's architecture is designed so that algobots are run as self-contained entities, that is, when algobots finish their execution they are unloaded from memory and put to rest until the following scheduled execution starts.</p>

                    <p>Each type of algorithm (extractor, indicator and trading) has a specific workflow, thus each of them are handled from separate Main Loop modules. However, all Main Loop modules share a similar structure:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>They first set up a structure of nested objects to be passed on to algorithms;</p></li>

                        <li><p>objects are initialized, exposing a number of public functions that algorithms can consume to perform their business operations;</p></li>

                        <li><p>the corresponding algorithm's processes are executed and objects are passed on;</p></li>

                        <li><p>once algorithms finish their run, the Main Loop stores the <em>context</em>;</p></li>

                        <li><p>and finally, sets the time for the next execution.</p></li>
                    </ul>
