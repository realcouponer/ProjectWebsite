<span class="tooltip-custom">Micro Exchange Offering<span class="tooltiptext-custom" style="text-align: justify;">The Superalgos Project aims to distribute ALGO Tokens to the public by means of rolling micro public offerings through a network of partner Exchanges. Offerings shall happen as each Exchange is on-boarded to start its own Competitions. Each Exchange shall sell a number of ALGO tokens to its own clients. <strong>This distribution strategy intends to serve Exchange's clients as they start using the Superalgos Platform, satisfying the organic demand for the ALGO Token to access Superalgos Platform services. </strong></span></span>
