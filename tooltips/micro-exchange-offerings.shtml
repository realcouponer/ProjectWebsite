<span class="tooltip-custom">Micro Exchange Offerings<span class="tooltiptext-custom" style="text-align: justify;">In the future, the Superalgos Project aims to distribute Intelli Tokens to the public by means of rolling micro public offerings through a network of partner Exchanges. Offerings shall happen as each Exchange is on-boarded to start its own Competitions. Each Exchange shall sell a number of Intelli Tokens to its own clients. <strong>This distribution strategy intends to serve Exchange's clients as they start using Superalgos, satisfying the organic demand for the Intelli Token to access products and services offered by Superalgos users through the Superalgos Network. </strong></span></span>
