<span class="tooltip-custom">Bundled Volume Discounts<span class="tooltiptext-custom" style="text-align: justify;">Exchanges charge Transaction Fees on every trade, and usually offer discounts to clients trading substantial volumes. <strong>The agreement with Exchanges provisions for all of the volume originating at federated nodes to be bundled and computed for additional discounts</strong> on top of the discounts each Exchange grants to individual accounts within the said Exchange. Bundled-Volume Discounts are automatically distributed back to Node Operators of federated nodes on a pro-rata basis of the volume contributed to the bundle. Node Operators may choose to pass on the benefit to the users of the node, as a means to promote the use of the said node.</span></span>
