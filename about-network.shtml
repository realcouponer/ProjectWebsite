                        <p>The main purpose of the Superalgos Network is to remove trust requirements by allowing all stakeholders to run their instances of Superalgos, as a network node.</p>
                        <p>Anyone may download the Superalgos Node and deploy it in their server, becoming a Node Operator.</p>
                        <p>Node Operators may run the software for their use or offer a hosted solution for users who chose to trust the operator with their Strategies/Algorithms and/or Exchange API Keys.</p>

                        <p>Superalgos Nodes work mostly on a stand-alone, independent basis in terms of their core activities, but may speak with each other to consume data and services from other nodes and to relay relevant network information.</p>
                        <p>The data and services a <!--#include file="tooltips/strategy.shtml" --> running in a node may consume from other nodes, may be black-boxed (offered on an input/output basis, without revealing how the output is obtained) and sold for micro fees, payable in <!--#include file="tooltips/intelli-tokens.shtml" --> in between Algorithms. The transactions may include indicator data, signals or any form of trading intelligence that lives distributed across the network.</p>

                        <p>The <!--#include file="tooltips/superalgos-organization.shtml" --> will enter into contractual relationships with <!--#include file="tooltips/exchanges.shtml" --> to ensure the best possible level of service to all parties involved in the <!--#include file="tooltips/marketplace.shtml" -->.</p>
                        <p>The agreement with Exchanges extends to the implementation of a built-in incentive mechanism designed to encourage Node Operators and <!--#include file="tooltips/algo-makers.shtml" --> to run their Algorithms in the Superalgos Network instead of running them in any other possible way (stand-alone, other platforms, etc.).</p>
                        <p>Under such contractual agreement, each Exchange runs a Superalgos Exchange Node, which creates a federation with all Superalgos Nodes trading on the said Exchange, while running the latest unmodified official release version of the software.</p>
                        <p>Exchanges charge Transaction Fees on every trade and usually offer discounts to clients trading substantial volumes.</p>

                        <p>The agreement provisions for all of the volume originating at federated nodes to be bundled and computed for additional discounts on top of discounts each Exchange grants to individual accounts within the said Exchange.</p>
                        <p>In technical terms, federated nodes route their orders through the Exchange Node so that the Exchange may account for the volume coming from each node and to enable the Superalgos Organization to audit the said volume.</p>
                        <p>Then, additional discounts are automatically distributed back to Node Operators of federated nodes on a pro-rata basis of the volume contributed to the bundle. Node Operators may choose to pass on the benefit to users of the node, as a means to promote the use of the said node.</p>
                        <p>Existing talks confirm that, until the networkï¿½s business evolves into a more mature state in which there will be real numbers to analyze, Exchanges may give back 50% of the gross profit generated from Transaction Fees in the form of additional discounts.</p>
